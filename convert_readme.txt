convert.py = converters of file to DNA sequence.
deconvert.py = converters the DNA sequence back to original file.
both.py - works as first converter of file to DNA and back to original file from the DNA.

Explanation of both.py
DNA File Conversion System

Overview
This project allows you to **convert any file** (text, images, PDFs, etc.) into a DNA sequence and later **reconstruct the original file** from the DNA sequence. This process is based on encoding binary data as DNA bases (A, T, G, C) and decoding it back.

Features
- Supports **any file type** (text, images, PDFs, etc.).
- Converts **binary data** to **DNA sequences**.
- Stores **metadata** for proper reconstruction.
- Recovers the **original file** from the DNA sequence.

How It Works
1. The file's **binary data** is read and converted to an 8-bit binary string.
2. The binary data is mapped to **DNA bases** (`A`, `T`, `G`, `C`).
3. The DNA sequence is saved in a file.
4. A **metadata file** stores the original file's extension and size.
5. To reconstruct, the DNA sequence is converted **back to binary**, and the metadata is used to restore the file.

Installation
Ensure you have **Python 3** installed and the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install numpy pillow
```

Usage
1) Convert a File to DNA
```python
file_to_dna("input_file.txt", "output_dna.txt", "metadata.txt")
```
- `input_file.txt`: The file to convert.
- `output_dna.txt`: The DNA sequence output file.
- `metadata.txt`: Stores file extension and size.

2) Convert DNA Back to Original File
```python
dna_to_file("output_dna.txt", "metadata.txt", "reconstructed_file")
```
- `output_dna.txt`: The DNA sequence file.
- `metadata.txt`: The metadata file.
- `reconstructed_file`: The output filename (auto-appends correct extension).

Example
Convert a File to DNA:
```sh
python convert_to_dna.py text.pdf output_dna.txt metadata.txt
```

Convert DNA Back to a File:
```sh
python convert_from_dna.py output_dna.txt metadata.txt reconstructed.pdf
```

Limitations
- Large files create **very long DNA sequences**, requiring high storage and processing time.
- Binary-encoded **DNA is not biologically meaningful** and is intended for data storage only.
